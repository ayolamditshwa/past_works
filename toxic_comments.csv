26,"misrepresenting administrator scope please take care not to misrepresent how administrators are expected to act, or any other policy in the future - administrators do not make content decisions. what you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. you view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. administrators do not make content decisions. see below. please also do not change my view - i suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 you are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   you have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). flonight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the sab remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   it is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). no administrator has made blocks for violations of wp:npov, wp:v, and wp:nor because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. would you like arbitrator clarification?   did you read what i said above? no administrator has made blocks for violations of wp:npov, wp:v, and wp:nor because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. see also: . 
discussing content issues at a conduct rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between article rfc and rfc on user conduct for that reason. what is acceptable is pointing editors to an article rfc so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   so please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). article rfc is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   it seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden. also, it contributes to the confusion editors have about wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. therefore, i am referring it directly to the committee.",0

however, there might be a lot to say about senator clinton!  the wikipedia yom kippur war article is long yet it was a very short event of days, compared to clinton's nearly 60 years of life.  vote:  do not shorten for the sake of shortening. i think the """"very long"""" tag may date back to before when material was split off into subarticles.  the article is still kind of long even after that, but manageable i think.  however imagine what will happen if she gets elected president!  all that has come before will be dwarfed by the new material to come. regarding the """"cv section"""" that you ( i was orginally very confused about her background because it takes work to figure out when she was practicing law and if it overlapped with being first lady.  a short list of jobs is useful.  what's there to hide.  she was never in prison.  she worked for a prestigous law firm. her practicing law did overlap with being first lady of arkansas, but not with being first lady of the united states.    the tag is meant for the article page, not the talk page. the article is currently around 67kb, which is long. talk/contribs really being wikipedia npov: we need to treat people fairly, not have a double standard
the opening paragraph has been very slightly modified to match that of christopher dodd, another democratic presidential contender.  we should treat them fairly and the same.  we still give senator clinton the honor of mentioning that she's first lady and has several first.i don't see how you can be against it unless you aren't fair.  if this isn't the case and you want to change it, explain why inconsistency is fair? why are you picking only dodd?  look at barack obama, john edwards, john kerry ... i've looked at `1/3 to 1/2 of all the senator articles, and all the 2008 presidential candidate articles, and there is absolutely no consistency among them in their intros.  but let me ask you this, what is your objection to the current intro?    dodd is from ct, that borders ny.  first, we make consistency between dodd and clinton, then we'll worry about the others?  i can't see how you can be for inconsistency.  it just isn't fair!  and fairness and npov is what wikipedia is all about.  what's so bad with dodd's intro?  it isn't negative or inaccurate. inconsistency of arrangement of neutral and unquestioned biographical details in an intro is not a matter of fairness or npov - it's just plain old inconsistency - so your argument is a red herring.  your chance of getting all these articles to have consistent intros is zero, take my word for it.  your revised intro to this article wasn't as good as the existing one, because it was a bit redundant and had faulty wikilinking.  again, what is your agenda here?  what do you think is wrong with what we have?      for one thing, dodd is called a politician, which he is.  hillary's occupation as politician is missing.  someone is really a politician when they run for more than one office.  jesse ventura is difficult to call a politician cuz he just ran for one office then went back into wrestling or related jobs. you are wrong about ventura.  he was a mayor before he was governor and he was also involved in the shaping of third-party political organizations.  so he is a politician just as much as hrc or anyone else.  for the most part, however, i think it is redundant to say someone is a politician when you say they are a senator and running for president - obviously they are politicians.  i just sampled a bunch of articles, and maybe 1/3 use 'politician' in the intro.  being wikipedia, it's ve",0

230,""":yeah, there is an article about that in wiki too:pre-greek substrate. the -ulis suffix however poses no problem to include it as an ie suffix, you will find such suffixes throughout ie and they are traced back to pie (latin -ula, alb. -ullë, greek -ule (kotyla), in slavic there is proto-slavic *sedulo, germanic *sadulaz (>english saddle) etc. etc. in greek -ulis does not appear to be that common, but -ule (arbule) is common enough. if someone were to collect all the -ulis examples in greek, you probably won't find any indication of a pre-ie origin for it, and even a thracian or illyrian origin may not fit the data. it's probably native to greek or some greek dialects. in the case of bombylis and arbylis, bomb- here means """"bubble"""" or some such (greek pomphos, """"bubble""""), and such forms are found in ie (french pompon of obscure origin) & non-ie i think, while arb- (meaning """"curved"""", """"arched""""?) may also be ie, i just haven't checked yet. anyway these greek suffixes don't prove that it is also a suffix in bardylis, but that's more likely than a two-word compound.

after i left egypt, i went to south africa and was discipled in christ there. when i began ministering to muslims in south africa, i became very well known by my muslim name. for four years radical muslims pursued me diligently. i had to hide all the time and change my residency from one city to another almost on a monthly basis. when i wrote my first book in south africa, my pastor and i discussed whether i should put my name on it. we decided to change my name for security reasons.reason #2
i was not comfortable living my christianity by a muslim name. i felt my muslim name was part of my old man. when a person called me by that  name, it reminded me of my old life. i want to live by a christian name.choice of name
i chose the first name of mark because mark was a writer of the gospels. mark was also the first christian who went to egypt with the good news. when jesus sent the seventy out from jerusalem, mark brought the gospel to the city of alexandria in egypt. i chose the last name of gabriel because gabriel was the angel who brought the good news of the coming of the messiah to the virgin mary. also this was the name of the first christian person i met in south africa who took me into his home and invited me to his church.this proves that this man is not a hoax, and is not more than one author.  | talk """,0

as the da vinci code fictional story, many disbelieve, that mary had descendants through jesus having children, as inconsistent with their core beliefs in christianity imputing that if jesus had children he didnt die on the cross and go to heaven. 
but jesus having children was prophecied serveral times in isaiah 
see -
he shall see his seed - isaiah 53: 10 
he shall sprinkle his seed across many nations - isaiah 52:15
thus saith the lord, the holy one of israel, and his maker, ask me of things to concerning my sons ... isaiah 45: 11
...
and so, then the subject cannot be blythly ignored with off point attacks about timing as jesus having had children before he died on the cross and went to heaven, is not inconsistent with any christian belief.the only source for a rational discussion of this is the book, the jesus presidents laying it all out vs the off point rants about this or that

573,"september 2005 (utc)one of the great things about bayesian stats is that you can do things directly rather than indirectly, as in frequentist stats. for example, in frequentist stats you can't attach a probability to a hypothesis, so you can't talk about the probability of the hypothesis given the data. instead, you have to mess around with the probability of the data given the hypothesis, which is not really what you want. bayesian hypothesis testing is thus very simple in principle (though the sums may get hard in practice). you attach a prior probability to the hypothesis, multiply by the likelihood and divide by the probability of he evidence to normalise it. the point i was making was that probabilities of zero and one make poor choices as priors. (i am not saying that bayesian stats generally has a problem with zero and one as probabilities, just when they are used as priors.) your mention of linear models and so on suggests that you are thinking in terms of bayesian methods of parameter estimation, whereas i was thinking in terms of bayesian hypothesis testing. 15:28, 20",0

n ← 1000000 // limit// initialize the sieve
is_prime(2) ← true
is_prime(i) ← [i is odd], ∀ i ∈ [3, n]for all odd a such that 3 ≤ a and a² ≤ n:
    for all odd b such that a ≤ b and ab ≤ n:

n ← 1000000 // limit// initialize the sieve
is_prime(2) ← true
is_prime(i) ← [i is odd], ∀ i ∈ [3, n]for all odd a such that 3 ≤ a and a² ≤ n:

this is an oooold subject/section here, but i agree, the highly detailed diagram is quite scary-looking to a novice reader, and much more complicated than the basics of the topic. start with something simpler, since there are certainly simpler aspects of diffraction than multislit-with-vectors. file:wave diffraction 4lambda slit.png would certainly be an improvement (simpler case, still a pretty picture that clearly illustrates some key ideas). i think that diagram would be even better if the barrier/slit were actually visible clearly rather than just another thin black line in a parallel field of black lines: consider either file:difraction.png or file:difrakce sterbina bodova.png. somewhat related, seems like there is no navbox for the wave-phenomena articles. having a directory of the reflection, refraction, diffraction, interferences, etc. main articles would be a great way to tie together all these pages and help students work through/among them.   20:14",0

the reason why i know that th1980 has access to the sources is because, firstly, he explicitly mentioned having access to henshall and other sources during the good article review, and secondly, he himself has cited these books in the article. you can surely see that the answers to your questions are much more straightforward than sinister. off-topic questions have filled up the talk page before, but none of it actually achieved anything. we certainly have a chance to achieve real progress, but going off on so many tangents, in a thread which is supposed to be about article structure, is hardly productive. if we don't have a consensus on article structure, we would do better to discuss the relative merits of mediation versus request for comment.",0

1. preliminary investigations;
2. preliminary hearing;
3. trial;
4. appeals.after the preliminary hearing, the judge only decides whether or not the evidence gathered so far is enough to sustain a case in court. if so, he sends the defendant before the judge of the trial, where he will be convicted or acquitted; if not, the judge sort of acquits the defendant.a defendant can, though, choose to give up his right to a trial. he will be, then, tried by the judge of the preliminary hearing, who will hand down a judgement, based upon the evidence gathered so far.since this is a reduction of the defendant's rights, it must be he who asks for a fast-track trial. in exchange for that, he is compensated with a lighter sentence. if there are two or more defendants, one may opt for a fast-track trial and the other choose to stick to the standard pattern. in this case, since it would be unfair (or so italians think) to let the wishes of one of them take precedence over those of the other, the two defendants are tried separately, even though they committed the same crime.   14:05, 11",0

2208,"""dear colleagues, 
i thank the various administrators and editors for their patience, and for their comments here, on the various talk pages and by email. many comments have been made about procedural failures. each of my steps in the dispute resolution process is prefaced with a request for advice and direction about how to do this properly, as i note here, because i did not know how to request, or manage, an ani conduct review or medcom mediation properly. a decision to block me was made, which i will not contest, based on comprehensive notes from two editors and accusations that i provide no evidence. i did not know how or when to do so, but i am learning quickly. in regard to arguments made by the editors  and , above, and upon which a decision was made to block me, i respond as follows:
 i reviewed a long history of contentious discussion and edits in historicity of jesus.
 i then posted a bold sourced here, which i encourage you to examine. you may see that they are in some cases minor clarifications, in others short simple neutrally toned presentations of divergent academic perspectives. in each instance the sources provided, apply only to the conceptual background of the claims made, and do not pertain to the specific line by line claims of this article, because, the citations largely concern the framework of the discussion not its extensive particulars.
 i started a talk page discussion
 smeat75 reverted my edit without discussion here
 smeat75 responded to my talk page discussion, but did not address the reasoning for the revision, here
 i continued discussion on the talk page and reverted back my edits here
 ian.thomson reverted my edit with note of """"you must develop consensus"""" here
 i reverted with note """"""""local consensus"""" is opposed by wikipedia:editing policy. wait for external review."""" here
 i requested external review at wp:rfc and continued discussion on the talk page here
 ian.thomson reverted the edit i requested review on, again, here
 external review collapsed as editors ignored process and comments from external parties
 i had been following what i knew of appropriate policy and felt i was being repeatedly reverted without discussion or attempts to communicate, so...
 i then requested dispute resolution here, please read """"dispute overview""""
 dispute resolution was opened, great comments received from many editors, and closed unresolved, as explained here
 on advice of drn i applied to ani for advice on resolution of conduct conflicts here, and to medcom for content mediation here
 medcom opened the request, 5 editors to date have agreed to mediation
 ani administrator then blocked me without addressing my request for advice, nor making inquiries with me and apparently based solely on the comments of two editors about which i have conduct concerns.my specific conduct concerns, about some editors, are outlined below.

 the """"genre"""" field should be limited to genres that describe the album (or group, or whatever) in general, and not every genre that has been incorprated into it.  imagine what the beatles' infobox would look like otherwise.
 the sources you are citing are not necessarily supporting the genres you're adding: for instance, earles says: """"side b is ... proto-sabbath sludge metal or proto-noise rock, depending on how you wish to retroactively consider this stuff against the underground rock history that came before and has transpired since ... etc etc doom metal scene etc etc power- and thrash-metal movements ..."""" ... it takes quite an imagination to read that and conclude that my war is a """"sludge metal album"""".

 some thoughts:
yes, if you define """"environmental journal"""" as any journal that ever published an article dealing with environmental issues. determining this will often involve original research and interpretation.
no, if you go by the inclusion criteria given in the lead of this list: this journal clearly is not """"focused"""" on environmental issues, even though they may be included in the scope.
no, if you go by the journal's homepage, which not even mentions the word """"environmental"""".
so it all depends on how you want to define """"environmental journal"""". personally, i would define that as a journal dedicated to environmental issues, not just any journal that occasionally also publishes something related. but i also know that david tends to go for the latter, wider definition -)   """,0

3. aerosol scattering has almost no wavelength dependence, reducing the dominance of blue light influence below that expected from pure rayleigh scattering and the rsi of keith.
4. but, the purkinje effect makes the eye more sensitive to white/blue rich light when dark adapted (most relevant when looking at/adapted to sky glow; only marginally relevant when looking at/adapted to outdoor night lighting levels), increasing again the dominance of white/blue-rich sources.
5. the bortle scale has made very little or no penetration into professional astronomy - astronomers, when they characterize skyglow at all, still use mag/arcsec2.  bortle scale is being used by amateurs and is being investigated in some detail by us national park service as a useful scale to characterize night sky quality.  finally, the bortle scale uses much more than just sky glow to characterize skies.

 i propose never using metric horsepower as a primary unit unless it's a special case like the bugatti.  and then we should be very specific in including the sae number.
 we've already decided to always include both hp and kw, and that's all well and good.
 as for notation, if we are to specify sae, i would do it without parentheses since we are using the parens for kw already.  so we say """"100 hp sae (74 kw)"""".  i'd rather not include the sae at all, but this is a reasonable alternative.

i've moved this copypasted pastiche to draft space as it wasn't ready for mainspace.   a few points to remember:there is nothing to split from the cuisine of hawaii article.  splitting occurs when we have too much content and some must be moved elsewhere.  that is not the situation here.  there is nothing to remove from the parent topic.  
what was recommended is for an editor to take up the task of expanding the subject, spinning out the topic into a new daughter article.  this involves an editor who is willing and interested to research and write about the cuisine of native hawaiian and to give it an expanded scope and treatment in a larger space.  this means expanding what we already have, not moving it to another article and adding more copypaste from other articles.  writing means, doing the research, reading the books and scholarly papers, and doing the hard work.  it does not mean taking what we already have and duplicating it over and over again.  that's not how this works.
you basically duplicated the entire cuisine of hawaii article here.  since that's a completely different topic, it makes no sense to talk about ethnic and local cuisine here.  if you don't know what the cuisine of native hawaii entails, then do the research.  it does not mean any food that anyone of native hawaiian ethnicity eats.  it has a specific, pre-contact definition and scope.
when you copied the content, you also copied the sources without adding the actual references.  as a result,  nobody can easily verify the content.  of course, i can, since i'm the one that went to the library and found the books and cited them in the original article.  you will have to add each full source to this article, otherwise it will get moved back to draft/sandbox space again.  you can't just keep copying material without doing the hard work.  you will need to add each single full reference to this article.  don't expect others to cleanup after you, especially when other editors did the actual research and footwork you refuse to do.
per the mos, please do not surround text with multiple images.  candleabracadabra, you've been reminded of this many times now.  keep this in draft space until you've done the necessary work.  this will involve serious research on your part. it will not involve copying and pasting material from already existing articles.   ==",0

please note that repeated attempts to remove sourced material from articles is likely to be considered to be edit warring, which may result in your being blocked from further editing of wikipedia either temporarily or permanently.  if you try to make a significant change to an article, and somebody else reverses it, the appropriate thing to do is to go to the talk page, have a reasoned discussion, and try to come to a joint view of what is the best way forward for the article (see wp:brd).  merely trying to ram through the change you want to make by altering the article again and again is not acceptable, and will lead to sanctions being applied.for the moment, the article haplogroup o-m176 (y-dna) has been locked for two weeks, so that no-one may edit it.  if you sincerely believe that there are issues with some of the material being presented, please discuss your concerns on the talk page, and try to find an acceptable way forward.  note, however, that wp exists to make accessible material that has been published in what it considers to be reliable sources.  if the material appears significant and relevant to the article, and has been published in a legitimate academic journal, normally one would expect to find it included in the article.  even if the material is questionable, if it is in wide circulation and often presented in discussions of the topic, then on those grounds alone it should still be included.  if there are good grounds for questioning the material, those grounds can be discussed in the article  but note that they must reflect the position of reliable sources that have been published and can be referenced, not just your own personal beliefs, knowledge, or unpublished research.

well, i seem to be in the minority... but i think two things add a little more weight to the notability of the incident:
the fact that psu was specifically noted for its support of vt (in fact, there's a picture of it directly to the left of the section we're discussing).
the (rather bizzare) fact that the students quite vehemently refuse to apologize for it. in fact, if you read the article, i didn't even pull out the most offensive quotes. as a side note, this is also why i'm not particularly concerned about this """"haunting them for the rest of their lives"""".

to all you people who think the president is doing such a terrible job. why don't you run for president and when you get elected try and do it better. it's really easy to play the """"monday morning quarterback"""". its one thing to disagree with his foriegn policy, it another to criticise him for decisions he made, when you don't know what information he had at the time. we may not have the best system, but at least we have a man who is not afraid of making the tough calls.
